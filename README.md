# Event-Sourcing-Visualizer #
An Event Sourcing visual illustration I put together

## Requirements ##
This project requires node v6.0+ and npm v3+.  Please note that it depends on the Less Css compiler, which often seems to be broken on the most recent node releases.

## To run ##

```shell
npm start
```

It will build and start a local server on port 3000.

## To build ##

```shell
npm build
```

The build will be in the ./dist folder.
