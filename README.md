# Game-of-Life-Elm
An Elm implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  My first attempt at an Elm app.

## Requirements
  - node/npm

## Running the Game
To start the game, clone the repo and navigate to the directory, then run

```bash
npm start
```

It should open in your browser of choice at ```http://localhost:3000```.

Not much to it.  It's just a small app I threw together to teach myself the basics of the Elm architecture.
